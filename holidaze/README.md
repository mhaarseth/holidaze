# **Semester Exam 2 - Hilodaze**

## Assignment brief and goal

"A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues."

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
